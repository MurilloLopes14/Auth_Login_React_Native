# Auth_Login_React_Native


### About the project

This time I tried something more interesting to do inside Native language, then I made it with firebase.

### Obs

- I didn't code everything into components so many thing that could be a component aren't one (Ex. Messages, Buttons, Errors, etc);
- The code is kind of "non-clean" because it's just a project for training the language
